<p style="font-weight:bold; font-size:large">ELIGIBILITY FOR ADOPTION ASSISTANCE</p>

<b>109.2</b>

<p style="font-weight:bold;">Requirement:</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold;">Eligibility for all types of Adoption Assistance is directly related to the child meeting Special Needs Criteria (as determined by the State&#47;Tribe) as defined below, and the Adoption Assistance Agreement being discussed, signed, and dated by all parties prior to the finalization of the adoption.</p>

<span>The availability of Adoption Assistance shall be discussed with anyone expressing interest in adopting child(ren) with special needs.  An Application shall be submitted for any person who requests Adoption Assistance for child(ren) being adopted (other than step-parents or parents who have previously surrendered their parental rights or had their parental rights terminated).</span>

<p>109.2  Procedures:</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold;">1. MONTHLY ADOPTION ASSISTANCE:</p>  

<p style="font-weight:bold;">A.	Title IV-E Adoption Assistance - The Title IV-E adoption subsidy has specific requirements that must be met prior to claiming Federal reimbursement.  These requirements include:</p> 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)	Special Needs Criteria Being Met - The State&#47;Tribe must determine that the child is a child with special needs in accordance with the criteria established in the Social Security Act.  The child must meet the Federal and State Special Needs criteria.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)	The State&#47;Tribe has determined, pursuant to established criteria, that the child cannot or should not return to the home of his or her parents, and</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)	The State&#47;Tribe has determined that, except where it would be against the best interests of the child because of such factors as the existence of significant      emotional ties&#47;bonds with prospective adoptive parents while in the care of the parents as a foster child, a reasonable, but unsuccessful, effort has been made to place the child with appropriate adoptive parents without providing adoption assistance under this section or medical assistance under title XIX, and</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)	The State&#47;Tribe has determined that there exists with respect to the child a specific factor or condition (such as ethnic background, age, or membership in a minority or sibling group, or the presence of factors such as medical conditions or physical, mental, or emotional handicaps) because of which it is reasonable to conclude that the child cannot be placed with adoptive parents without providing adoption assistance under this section and medical assistance under title XIX;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)	<span style="font-weight:bold;">The State of Georgia</span> requires that a child <span style="font-weight:bold;">meets</span> at minimum one of the following special needs criteria at the time of special needs determination (as determined by the State&#47;Tribe), which must occur prior to the child being placed on adoptive status in order for Adoption Assistance benefits to be effective when a child is placed on adoptive status.</p>
Please Note: After an initial request has been made for Special Needs Determination, subsequent requests may be made (based on changing circumstances) up until the point of the child's placement on adoptive status.  See Glossary of Terms&#47;Definitions for the definition of &quot;adoptive status&quot;.

<p style="font-weight:bold;">SPECIAL NEEDS CRITERIA - <i>EFFECTIVE March 1, 2010</i></p>

<ul><li>	<b>A child who has been in the care of a public or private agency or individual other than the legal or biological parent for more than 24 consecutive months.<br>

Please Note: 24 consecutive months is calculated by using the date of the child's most recent removal to the date of the special needs determination request.  A special needs determination may be requested up until the signing of the Adoption Placement Agreements (Form 33&#47;37) for children in the permanent custody of DFCS, up until finalization for all private&#47;independent adoptions (Non-DFCS Involved Adoptions) and up to the signing of the Adoption Assistance Agreement (Form 402) for children transferred from DFCS temporary custody to the custody of a specified relative&#47;individual for the purpose of adoption (must be signed prior to adoption finalization).</b></li>

<li>	<b>A child with a physical, mental, or emotional disability, as validated by a licensed physician or psychologist.</b><br></li>

<li>	<b>A child who is a member of a sibling group of two or more placed in the same home.</b><br></li></ul>

<p><b>Please Note:  Siblings are not required to be placed for adoption at the same time in order to meet the above criterion.  A second sibling may be placed into the same home as a previously placed sibling and thus meet the above special needs criteria. However, if the previously placed sibling was not determined to meet special needs criteria, he&#47;she would not become eligible based on the second sibling being placed in the same home at a later time.  He&#47;she would remain non-special needs.</b></p>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">SPECIAL NEEDS CRITERIA - <i>PRIOR TO March 1, 2010</i></span><br>
<b>(The following special needs criteria were utilized for all special needs determination <u>requests</u> submitted prior to March 1, 2010.  These criteria are not utilized for special needs determination requests after February 28, 2010) </b>
  <ul><li>	<b>Eight years of age or older</b></li>
  <li>	<b>A child of black heritage and is one year of age or older</b></li>
  <li>	<b>Member of a sibling group of three or more to be placed together at the same time</b></li>
  <li>	<b>Member of a sibling group of two placed together at the same time where one is over the age of eight or has another special need</b></li>
  <li>	<b>A child with documented physical, emotional, or mental health problems or limitation.</b></li></ul>

<p style="font-weight:bold;"><a NAME="APPLICABLE">IN</a> ADDITION TO MEETING THE SPECIAL NEEDS CRITERIA, TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR IV-E ADOPTION ASSISTANCE, A CHILD MUST MEET THE IV-E CRITERIA FOR EITHER THE &quot;APPLICABLE CHILD&quot; OR THE &quot;NON-APPLICABLE CHILD&quot;, as described in the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-351):</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)	<font style="font-weight:bold;">Applicable Child:</font></p>

<p>The &quot;applicable child&quot; is a child who meets the criteria of the &quot;Applicable Child&quot; in the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-351) and other required IV-E criteria listed below:</p>

<p>Applicable Child &#47; Age - The State must apply the &quot;applicable child&quot; eligibility requirements to anyone who is an &quot;applicable child&quot; based on his or her age if the child has attained the applicable age, as indicated in section 473(e)(1)(B) of the Social Security Act, any time before the end of the Federal fiscal year during which the adoption assistance agreement is entered into.  The applicable age for a child begins at 16 years old in FFY 2010 and decreases by two years for each fiscal year until a child of any age meets the applicable age requirements in FFY 2018.</p>

<p><b>Applicable Child &#47; Time in Foster Care and Siblings.</b>  As of FFY 2010, the law also defines an &quot;applicable child&quot; to include: (1) a child who has been in foster care under the responsibility of the State&#47;Tribal agency for at least 60 consecutive months; or (2) a child who is a sibling of an applicable child by virtue of age or time in foster care and is placed in the same adoption arrangement as his&#47;her sibling.  </p>

<p style="font-weight:bold;"><a NAME="APPLICABLE_IVE">The</a> &quot;Applicable Child&quot;, in addition to meeting Special Needs Criteria, must also meet one of the following four eligibility requirements (a, b, c, or d) for IV-E Adoption Assistance payments to be made:</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a)	Child meets specific requirements at the initiation of adoption proceedings:  the child, at the time of the initiation of adoption proceedings, was in the care of a public or licensed private child placement agency or Indian tribal organization pursuant to:
<ul>
<li>	An involuntary removal in accordance with a judicial determination to the effect that it was contrary to the child's welfare to remain in the home; OR<br>
<li>	A voluntary placement agreement or voluntary relinquishment.  Thus, for an &quot;applicable child&quot;, there does not have to be a title IV-E payment made under a voluntary placement agreement.<br>
</ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b)	Child meets all medical or disability requirements of SSI:  Child meets all medical or disability requirements of Title XVI with respect to eligibility for SSI benefits.  <b>An &quot;applicable child&quot; does not have to meet the needs-based requirements for SSI (See 109.20).</b>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c)	Child of a minor parent:  the child was residing in a foster family home or child care institution with his&#47;her minor parent and the minor parent was removed from home pursuant to either: (1) an involuntary removal in accordance with a judicial determination to the effect that it was contrary to the child's welfare to remain in the home; or (2) a voluntary placement agreement or voluntary relinquishment.
	
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d)	Child was eligible in a prior adoption:  the child was adopted and was determined eligible for title IV-E adoption assistance in a prior adoption (or would have been found eligible had the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 been in effect at the time of the previous adoption), and is available for adoption because the prior adoption has been dissolved or the child's adoptive parents have died.  In such an instance, the child may retain eligibility for adoption assistance payments in a subsequent adoption.  The State&#47;Tribe only needs to determine that the child is still a child with special needs for the child to be eligible for adoption assistance.

<p style="font-weight:bold;">All other requirements in section 473(a) through (c) of the Social Security Act, the background check requirements in section 471(a)(20)(A) and (B) of the Act and 45 CFR 1356.30(b) and (c), the adoption assistance agreement requirements as defined in section 475(3) of the Act and regulation in 45 CFR 1356.40 and 1356.41 (to the extent that they are not superseded by the law) apply equally to both an applicable and a non-applicable child.</p>

<p style="font-size:large; font-weight:bold;"><a NAME="NON_APPLICABLE_IVE"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OR</a></p>

(3)	<b>Non-Applicable Child:</b>

<p style="font-weight:bold;">The &quot;non-applicable child&quot; is a child who does not meet the criteria for the &quot;applicable child&quot;.</p> 

<p style="font-weight:bold;">The &quot;non-applicable child&quot; must meet Special Needs Criteria as determined by the State&#47;Tribe and one of the requirements listed below (a, b, c or d) to be eligible for IV-E Adoption Assistance payments to be made:</p>  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a)	Child was removed from the home of a relative specified in section 406(a) of the Act (as in effect on July 16, 1996) and placed in foster care in accordance with a voluntary placement agreement with respect to which Federal payments are provided under section 474 (or section 403, as in effect on July 16, 1996), or in accordance with a judicial determination to the effect that continuation in the home would be contrary to the welfare of the child, and  <b>1)</b> received AFDC, in that relative's home, under the State plan approved under section 402 of the Act (as in effect 7&#47;16&#47;96), or would have received AFDC under such plan had application been made, in or for the month the voluntary placement agreement was entered into or court proceedings leading to the judicial determination referred to in section 473(a)(2)(A)(i) were initiated; or <b>2)</b> had been living with a relative specified in section 406(a) of the Act within six months before the month in which a voluntary placement agreement was entered into or court proceedings leading to the judicial determination referred to in section 473(a)(2)(A)(i), were initiated and would have received AFDC in that relative's home under the State plan approved under section 402 of the Act for that month, if in that month the child had been living with such relative and application had been made
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b)	Child meets all the requirements of title XVI of the Act with respect to eligibility for supplemental security income benefits (See 109.20).
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c)	Is a child whose costs in a foster family home or child-care institution are covered by the foster care maintenance payments being made with respect to the minor parent of the child as provided in section 475(4)(B).
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d)	In the case of a child who is not an applicable child for the fiscal year as defined in 473(e), the child will be treated as meeting the requirements to receive adoption assistance payments if the child:
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1)	meets the requirements of section 473(a)(2)(A)(i)(II); and
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2)	is determined eligible for adoption assistance payments under 473 of the Act with respect to a prior adoption; and
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3)	is available for adoption because the prior adoption has been dissolved and the parental rights of the adoptive parents have been terminated or because the child's adoptive parents have died; and 
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4)	fails to meet the requirements of section 473(a)(2)(A)(i) but will meet such requirements if the child is treated as if the child is in the same financial and other circumstances the child was in the last time the child was determined eligible for adoption assistance payments under section 473 of the Act and the prior adoption is treated as never having occurred.
