<b>2106.15 Reports of Abuse and Neglect in Private Agency and State Operated Homes</b><br>
<br>
The division is responsible for conducting investigations of abuse and neglect
in private agency family foster homes; foster/adoptive homes, adoptive homes and
state operated family foster homes regardless of the legal custody status of the
children placed in these resources. Children in these settings may be in the
custody of their parents, DFCS/DHR, the private agency; committed to the
Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ), or in joint custody of DFCS/DHR and DJJ.
As reports are received, question reporters about the legal status of children
in a private agency or state operated home. Reports that involve children in the
legal custody of DFCS/DHR require notification to the legal county and an
immediate to 24-hour response time. Private agency and state operated homes are
defined as follows: <br>
<br>
<b><li> Private Agency Homes:</b> Family foster homes, foster/adoptive homes, and adoptive
homes developed and approved by private agencies licensed by the Office of
Regulatory Services (ORS) for the placement of children. This includes
therapeutic and specialized foster homes receiving LOC payments. Children placed
in these homes may be in the custody of their parents, the private agency, or
DFCS. The division purchases foster care services from DFCS approved private
agencies for the placement of children in our legal custody. (See Foster Care
Services Manual, Appendix H, for a listing of these agencies. The county
department can verify the current approval status of an agency by contacting the
Social Services Section, Provider Support Unit.) The State Adoption Unit
contracts with licensed adoption agencies to provide foster/adoptive home and
adoptive home placements and supervision for children who are in our temporary
or permanent custody. Counties can verify the current approval status by
contacting the State Adoption Unit. Some state agencies, MH/MR/SA and DJJ, also
contract with private agencies for the placement of children.</li>
<b><li> State Operated Homes:</b> Family foster home resources developed and approved by
other state agencies such as MH/MR/SA, DJJ, and the agencies/associations with
which they have contracts. MH/MR/SA provides therapeutic foster home resources
for children. Children placed in MH/MR/SA resources may be in the legal custody
of their parents, DFCS/DHR, or in the joint custody of DFCS/DHR and DJJ. DJJ has
family contract homes for children adjudicated unruly or delinquent. Children
placed in these resources may be in the legal custody of DFCS/DHR, in joint
custody of DFCS/DHR and DJJ, or DJJ.</li>

<b>2106.29 Reports of Abuse and Neglect in Public and Private Non-Residential Schools</b><br>
<br>
DFCS has the authority and responsibility for accepting reports of suspected
abuse and neglect of children by school personnel in public and private
non-residential schools. There is a fundamental difference between public and
private schools in the State of Georgia: <br>
<br>
<b><li>Public non-residential schools</b> are under the oversight of the Department of
Education (DOE), but are administered by area, county, or independent boards of
education.</li>
<br>
<b><li>Private non-residential schools</b> are not licensed, regulated or certified by
any public agency and do not have to meet the same state standards or laws
governing public non-residential schools. Private non-residential school
administrators set internal policies and discipline methods for private schools.
When parents entrust the care of their child to a private non-residential
school, they grant those administrators the same rights to discipline their
child as the child's parent has.</li>
<br><br><br><br>

<b>2106.34 Reports of Abuse or Neglect in Non-Residential Facilities</b><br>

investigations of suspected child abuse and neglect in non-residential
facilities regardless of licensing status. Some examples of non-residential

<br>
<b><li>Group day care:</b> Any facility operated by any person, partnership, association,

licensed through the Office of School Readiness. Head Start Programs that
receive no funding through the Georgia Pre-K Program are licensed through ORS.
