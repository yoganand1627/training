						All foster care-related stages, including FCC, FCF, ADO, PAD and PFC, have relationships which are to the primary child. 
						<br>
						<br>
						<u>Child stages:</u> Each primary child has a relationship of ‘Self’ in his/her own stage[s].
						<br>
						<br>
						It is important to select the exact relationship to the child for each person in that child’s stage[s] and to make sure that each person has the correct Type [Principal/Collateral].
						<br>
						<br>
						<u>FCF stage:</u> Each primary child also has a relationship of “Self” in the FCF stage.  If there is a sibling group in care, this means there could be multiple relationships of ‘Self’ in this stage.  When a person’s relationship to one sibling differs from his/her relationship to another sibling, the ‘strongest’ relationship should display.  For example, if a man is a biological father to one child, but a step-father to another, the relationship which should display in the FCF stage is “Biological Father”.  
						<br>
						<br>
						<u>Automation:</u> Based on information from the previous stage when the Custody page is created, GA SHINES will auto-select the most likely relationships for all Principals in the FCC/FCF stages. To assist the system in determining its selections, prior to adding the Custody page, the following fields should be accurate on each Person Detail page: Type, Relationship, and, where applicable, all selections in the Caregiver/Parental Relationships Information for the Child section.
						<br>
						<br>
						GA SHINES will not always be able to determine the correct relationship.  When necessary, the Case Manager should adjust the relationship for the FCC stage on the Custody page.  Once the page is saved, the case manager will have to make any further modifications to relationships in the FCC stage on the Person Detail page.  The case manager should always review the auto-selected relationships in the FCF stage and adjust as necessary.
