 * This class demonstrates the degenerative case where the web service is backed by a single service.  In that case, the
 * web service input should extend the service input, and the service  output should extend the web service output
 * classes.
 * <p/>
 * For complex web services that call multiple services, these classes will need to be built by hand.
