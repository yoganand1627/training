<h2>Provisions of Agreement</h2><br />

adoptive parent(s) for the purposes of facilitating the legal adoption of the above named
child. The adoptive parent(s) verify that they will be unable to adopt said child without

<li>General Provisions

<p>Following the adoption finalization:</p>

<ol id="adoptionFinalizationList">
<li>This agreement may not be amended, suspended, or terminated, except as outlined in
this agreement <b>(Sections II.B., V., VI., VII.)</b> or by mutual written agreement of the parties.</li>

<li>This agreement cannot be transferred by the adoptive parent(s) to any other party.
  However, in the event of the death of the adoptive parent(s) or termination of their parental rights, 
  the child may remain eligible for assistance in a subsequent adoption. The new subsidy agreement 
  must be approved by the Department prior to the finalization of the adoption.

<ul>
<p></p>
<li><b>Please note the successor adoptive parent(s) must contact the County
Department.</b></li>
<p></p>
</ul>
</li>

<li>An ongoing monthly payment can be issued only to the adoptive parent.  In the event that 
there is a change in the custodial status of the child, the Department must be notified within 30 days.  
If a change in payee is necessary (i.e. divorce or death of an adoptive parent), a written request 
must be sent to the County Adoption Assistance worker with the supporting legal documentation attached.  
The County Department will consult with the Social Services Administration Unit in order to make a decision 
that is in line with Federal and State policy.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<p></p>
<li>Assistance

<ol id="assistanceList">
<p></p>
<li>Non-recurring Adoption Assistance (UAS 510) (State Funds Only):

<p>The Department agrees to reimburse the adoptive parent(s) for expenses that are
reasonable and necessary for the adoption to occur, up to <b>[[NON_RECURRING_LIMIT_AMT]]</b> 
per child for children deemed to meet the Special Needs Criteria.  
<u>Non-recurring Adoption Assistance is not approved when Adoption Assistance is Deferred.</u></p>

<p>In order for Non-recurring Adoption Assistance to be paid, the expenses must:</p>

<ol>
<li>Directly relate to the legal adoption, and,

<ul>
<li><b>Legal /Court fees</b></li>

<li><b>Travel/Lodging/Food for pre-placement visits.</b></li>

<li><b>Physicals for adoptive parent(s)&#39; adoptive home evaluation</b></li>
</ul>
</li>
<p></p>
<li>Not be in violation of state of federal law; and,</li>
<p></p>
<li>Not have been reimbursed for other sources of funds</li>
</ol>

<p>Reimbursement may only be applied for <b>after adoption finalization.</b> Reimbursement 
can only occur within 2 years of finalization.</p>
</li>

<li>Monthly Cash Payment:

<ol>
<p></p>
<li>The amount of the monthly Adoption Assistance cash payment is based on the needs 
of the child and the circumstances of the adoptive parent(s).  The amount is determined by 
mutual agreement between the adoptive parent(s) and the Department.</li>
<p></p>

<li>The amount of the Adoption Assistance payment may not exceed the Department&#39;s Family 
Foster Care Board Rate or Specialized DFCS Family Foster Care Board Rate the child would have 
received in Family Foster Care immediately prior to the adoptive placement.</li>
<p></p>

<li>If the monthly Adoption Assistance payment designated on this Agreement exceeds 
the assigned Department (DFCS) Family Foster Care Board Rate or Specialized Family Foster 
Care Board Rate, the monthly payment will be adjusted to an amount that does not exceed 
the assigned Family Foster Care Board Rate or Specialized Family Foster Care Board Rate.  
The adoptive parent(s) shall be given written notice of any adjustments to their monthly 
payment made pursuant to this paragraph.  The adjustment will take effect in the month 
immediately following the month the adoptive parents receive notice of the adjustment.</li>
<p></p>

<li>Adjustments in Adoption Assistance payments which decrease the monthly payment amount 
may only be made through mutual agreement with the adoptive parent(s) based upon changes 
in the needs of the child or family circumstances.  An exception to this requirement is the 
case in which across-the-board statewide adjustments are made which lower the monthly payment 
rate.  Adjustments in Adoption Assistance payments which increase the monthly payment amount 
will not be made after the signing of the Adoption Assistance Agreement, unless a child 
has a documented physical, mental, or emotional disability, as certified by a licensed 
physician or psychologist and <b>a waiver packet is approved by the Social Services Administration Unit.</b> 
Any rate increase still may not exceed what the child received while in foster care.  
An exception to this rule would be across-the-board statewide increases in the monthly 
payment authorized by the Department due to already-designated age level increases.</li>
<p></p>

<li>If it is determined by the Department that an overpayment has been made to the adoptive parent(s), 
the Department shall have the authority to collect the overpayment through a mutual agreement 
with the adoptive parent(s). <b>If this results in unsuccessful collection, the Department shall 
have the authority to pursue other legal remedies.</b></li>
<p></p>

<li>If the child in this Agreement is placed in Family Foster Care or a residential facility at state expense, 
the adoptive parent(s) may continue to receive Adoption Assistance payments if the permanency plan is 
reunification and the family&#39;s ongoing legal and financial responsibility for the child can be established. 
<b>For a child placed in a residential facility, the adoptive parent(s) will be asked to contribute to the 
child&#39;s out of home expenses.  If the State of Georgia determines that the adopted parent(s) are no longer 
legally or financially responsible for the child, Adoption Assistance will be terminated.</b></li>
<p></p>

<li>If the State of Georgia determines the adoptive parent(s) are no longer legally or financially responsible 
for the child(ren) and continues to receive Adoption Assistance payments, the family will be responsible for 
reimbursing the overpayment to the county department.
<b>If this results in unsuccessful collection, the Department shall have the authority to pursue other legal remedies.</b>
