						      Evaluative Conclusions may be used only in rare circumstances when 
						      the state is unable to secure evidence of citizenship from 
						      another listing.  The Evaluative Conclusions must be supplied by 
						      at least two individuals, one of whom is not related to the 
						      applicant or recipient.  Each must attest to having personal 
						      knowledge of the event(s) establishing the applicant’s or 
						      recipient’s claim of citizenship.  The individuals making the 
						      Evaluative Conclusions must be able to prove their own citizenship 
						      and identity for the Evaluative Conclusions to be accepted.  Those 
						      making Evaluative Conclusions will be subject to prosecution for 
						      perjury.  If the persons claiming knowledge of another’s 
						      citizenship has information which explains why documentary 
						      evidence establishing the applicant’s claim of citizenship does 
						      not exist or cannot be readily obtained, the Evaluative 
						      Conclusion should contain this information as well.  A second 
						      Evaluative Conclusion from the applicant/recipient or other 
						      knowledgeable individual explaining why documentary evidence does 
						      not exist or cannot be readily obtained must also be requested.
